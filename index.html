    <u><b> Wedding Announcement</b></u> <br>
We are getting married Saturday, January 7th, 2023 at <a href = http://www.hardingsnyc.com/>Harding's Restaurant </a> in New York City.  <br> <br>
The venue is in the Flatiron District of Manhattan, at 32 E 21st St, between 5th Avenue and Park Avenue. <br>
The wedding will start at 6 PM. There will be a brief ceremony, then light snacks until 7:30, and then a meal.<br>
<br>
<u><b> Where should we stay? </b></u><br>
We don't have a hotel with special rates for the wedding.<br>
We recommend finding housing early, especially if you would like to stay in the Flatiron District itself.<br>
One nearby hotel is SpringHill Suites Midtown Manhattan/Park Avenue.<br>
<br>
You may find roomier lodging if you opt to stay in Queens or Brooklyn, which are a quick subway or taxi ride to the wedding.<br>
If you are interested in splitting a hotel room with someone but don't know who to coordinate with, <a href="mailto:lee.and.hunter.wedding@gmail.com">e-mail us</a>.<br>
<br>
<u><b> How do we RSVP? </b></u><br>
Once you know you are coming, please <a href="mailto:lee.and.hunter.wedding@gmail.com">send us an e-mail</a> with your name and the names of all your guests.<br>
If you are not able to come, let us know by e-mailing the same address!<br>
<br>
<u><b> What should we wear? </b></u><br>
Please dress formally.<br>
<br>
<u><b> Is there a registry? </b></u><br>
It is already a generous gift to us for you to come to our "destination wedding," and we ask that you refrain from getting us wedding presents.<br>
<br>
<u><b> Should we take pictures? </b></u><br>
We will have a photographer for the ceremony only. Afterwards, please take lots of pictures and share them with us!<br>
<br>
<u><b> Can I bring a date? </b></u><br>
Probably! Let us know if this is your plan as there is a limit on the total number of people. <br>
Update! On several occasions, our initial invitation only went to one member of a couple, due to a coding error.<br>
We are sorry for this -- needless to say, you are both invited. <br>
<br>
<u><b> Can we bring our children? </b></u><br>
Children ten and above are welcome. Let us know about children under ten -- we don't have childcare and they might not have the best time.<br>
<br>
<u><b> How will we entertain ourselves in New York in the winter? </b></u> <br>
In addition to museums and plays, there is the famous skating rink near Rockefeller Center. <br>
If you have a "contactless" credit card or Apple Pay, you don't even need to buy a subway card to hop on the subway anymore.<br>
